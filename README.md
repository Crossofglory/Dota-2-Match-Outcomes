# Predicting Dota 2 Match Outcomes Through Chat Log Analysis

This repository contains the model codes for our paper investigating the use of in-game chat logs for predicting Dota 2 match outcomes using supervised learning approaches.

## Abstract
Our research analyzes a dataset of 50,000 ranked matches, evaluating the predictive power of communication data alone and in combination with game events. Using LSTM and DistilBERT architectures, alongside a logistic regression baseline, we demonstrate that chat logs alone enable accurate prediction (up to 81.4% accuracy), while incorporating game events substantially improves performance (up to 98.4% accuracy).
